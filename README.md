# Multi_Bot
Multi-function chatbot
The Multi-Bot Chatbot is a versatile application that provides three core functionalities:

Study Assistant: Leverages the Google API and a search engine to provide relevant information for study purposes. Users can ask questions or request information on various topics, and the chatbot will fetch results from the web to assist in learning.

Weather Prediction: Utilizes a weather API to predict weather conditions based on the city name provided by the user. Simply input the name of the city, and the chatbot will provide up-to-date weather information, including temperature, humidity, and forecast.

Chit-Chat Mode: Engages in casual conversation using a pre-trained model from Hugging Face. This mode allows for interactive and entertaining conversations, mimicking human-like dialogue.

This multi-functional chatbot aims to provide a comprehensive user experience by combining educational resources, weather forecasting, and friendly conversation, all in a single interface.
