# Multi_Bot
This multi-bot is a versatile chatbot system designed to handle three distinct functionalities within a single interface. The bot serves different purposes depending on the user’s needs, making it a multi-purpose tool with advanced capabilities. Here’s a breakdown of its components:

1. Student Q&A Bot (Google Generative AI)
This chatbot helps students by providing detailed answers to academic questions. It utilizes Google’s Generative AI, which enables it to generate informative and contextually relevant responses based on user queries. When a student asks a question, the bot processes the input and queries the Google Generative AI, which then delivers a two-paragraph description or explanation based on the query. This is useful for students looking for quick and accurate answers to educational or research-related queries.

2. Weather Prediction Bot (Weather API)
The weather prediction functionality allows users to get real-time weather updates by simply entering the name of a city. It integrates with the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch current weather data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather descriptions. This component is particularly helpful for users who need instant weather updates in a conversational format.

3. Chit-Chat Bot (Hugging Face Pre-trained Model)
This bot enables casual conversation using a Hugging Face pre-trained model (Blenderbot). It is designed for general, non-task-specific chatting, providing users with a more engaging conversational experience. The chit-chat bot can handle a wide range of topics, from casual small talk to slightly more complex conversations. It is a great way to maintain engagement with users, especially for those looking for a conversational AI companion.

4. Chat History
To enhance user experience, the system includes a chat history feature that tracks the entire conversation between the user and the bots. Whether the user is asking questions, checking the weather, or just having a casual chat, the bot records both the user’s input and the bot’s response. This allows users to refer back to previous messages without losing track of the conversation.
